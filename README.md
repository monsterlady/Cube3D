>   Implements Cube Rotation, lighting and back culling without using any frame but MVP matrix

## What is this Project?

It is a simple implementation of Cube rotation Windows Form APP using MVP matrix in .NET Core (C#).
Due to the time, the coding structure is not beautiful and needs to be strengthened later. 
As an assignment, it shows my understanding of how matrix works in games.

This project is fully based on Math class slides, two great Blog Articles and one video from Youtube.

### 2- 3D shapes - knowledge about matrix

## Notes:

:bulb: There are 2 different AI in the project:

#### :low_brightness: 1- Rotate Angle:
The rotate angle is hardcoded at **Timer1_Tick** method in **MyFrom.cs**, it rotate around all axis(default settings).
```
private void Timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            //Angle per sec
            a += 1;
            double angle = a / 360.0 * Math.PI;
            ...
        }   
```  

#### :low_brightness: 2- How to Operate:  
:bulb: You could choose the rotate axis by clicking the axis buttons below, for example:
<br>
<br>
Rotate around ***All*** axis: <br>
none button chosen<br>
<br>
Rotate around ***X*** axis: <br>
choose Y and Z button<br>
<br>
Rotate around ***Y*** axis: <br>
choose X and Z button<br>
<br>
Rotate around ***Z*** axis: <br>
choose X and Y button<br>
<br>

:bulb: Drag the slider bar on the top could scale the cube


I hope those could be useful !.
